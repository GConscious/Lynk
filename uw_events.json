We look forward to seeing you in person or online on Thursday, January 30, 4:45pm to 6:30 pm. This event will be held at the Center for the Arts Concert Hall on the GMU Fairfax campus and online via Zoom. RSVP is required to receive the Zoom link via email the day-of! RSVP: app.e2ma.net&#8230; Born in Vega Alta, Puerto Rico, Chemi Rosado-Seijo graduated from the painting department of the Puerto Rico School of Visual Arts in 1997. In 1998, he worked with Michy Marxuach to open a gallery that transformed into a not-for-profit organization presenting resources and exhibitions for contemporary artists in Puerto Rico.&#160; In 2000, Rosado had his first solo show at the Joan Miro Foundation in Barcelona, including interventions on billboards around the city. Since 2002, he has worked with residents of the El Cerro community, a poor neighborhood south of San Juan, to present public art projects, workshops and other community initiatives.&#160; In 2006, he inaugurated La Perla&#8217;s Bowl, a sculpture built with residents of San Juan&#8217;s La Perla community that functions as both a skateboarding ramp and a pool. Since 2009, Rosado-Seijo has been organizing exhibitions in his apartment in Santurce, creating a center for meeting and exchange in the Puerto Rican contemporary art scene. Rosado-Seijo&#8217;s work was included in the Whitney Biennial in 2017. In 2020, current School of Art faculty, Ben Ashworth, collaborated with Chemi Rosado-Seijo on The Ceremonial Bowl: vimeo.com&#8230;",

    "description": "Written by August Wilson Directed by &#160;Lili-Anne Brown &#160; The Acting Company returns with August Wilson&#8217;s Tony Award-winning play Two Trains Running. Set amid the civil rights movement, the drama centers on Memphis Lee, an African American diner owner whose business is set to be demolished for an urban renewal project. While Lee fights for fairness and dignity, his customers struggle with how gentrification is changing their lives in unpredictable ways. The Acting Company, recipient of a Tony Award for Excellence in the Theatre, is thrilled to bring to life Wilson&#8217;s vibrant characters, rich language, and thought-provoking ideas. Two Trains Running is a poignant tribute to the spirit and perseverance of the people who make our country great even when faced with overwhelming odds. This production&#160;is part of a repertory tour including The Comedy of Errors , presented in partnership with&#160;Play&#160;On&#160;Shakespeare, a non-profit company promoting and creating contemporary modern verse translations of Shakespeare&#8217;s&#160;plays.

Always an audience favorite, Kodo &#8217;s modern take on the ancient art form of taiko drumming will leave its audience breathless with its heart-pounding and stunningly athletic displays of musicianship. Since its debut in 1981, the group has given over 7,000 performances in more than 50 countries and regions on five continents. Aptly named&#8212;from the Japanese word for heartbeat, the primal source of all rhythm&#8212;Kodo can also be translated from the two characters that comprise it: ko, meaning &#8220;drum&#8221; and do, from the word for &#8220;child&#8221; to &#8220;Children of the drum.&#8221; The Boston Globe declares, &#8220;If there is such a thing as perfection in music, Kodo comes as near to it as any group in the world,&#8221; so make sure to catch this &#8220;celebration of music, of physicality, of life&#8221; ( New York Times ).

The quartet made its Grand Ole Opry Debut in 2023 to a sold-out crowd where they were joined by Garth Brooks, Trisha Yearwood, Steve Earle, and Lauren Alaina, among others. JigJam includes Ireland&#8217;s County Offaly natives Jamie McKeogh (lead singer and guitar); Daithi Melia (5-string banjo and dobro); Tipperary-born Gavin Strappe (mandolin and tenor banjo); and St. Louis, Missouri&#8217;s own Kevin Buckley (fiddle). These talented multi-instrumentalists have released three albums and are winning over audiences with their infectious blend of bluegrass and American folk. Celebrate the rich musical heritage of the Irish with &#8220;Ireland&#8217;s answer to New Grass Revival&#8221; ( Midwest Records ). This performance is appropriate for all ages.

RSVP: signup.e2ma.net&#8230; Adriana Monsalve (she /they) is an artist, educator, cultural worker and collaborative publisher working (mostly) in the photobook medium. Along with Caterina Ragg, Monsalve is co-founder of Homie House Press, a radical cooperative platform that challenges the ever-changing forms of storytelling with image and text. Within her photographic practice, Monsalve is an archivist and visual communicator who produces in-depth stories on identity through the nuances in between race, gender, and immigrant adjacent experiences. As an educator, she enacts radical imagination in the classroom daily. Monsalve believes it is the first step in building worlds we can safely live in. She says, &#8220;..art maps our journey toward liberation. To realize our freedom fantasies for our larger community, we also engage with education between the practices of imagination and creation. I am certain liberation comes in communal form, because the culture of white-supremacy that we were all born into, thrives on individualism.. In contrast, imagination taps into our desires, so that we can share (education) and realize them collectively (creation).&#8221; This event will be held at the Center for the Arts Concert Hall on the GMU Fairfax campus and online via Zoom.
