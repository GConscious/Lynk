## What is Lynk?

A platform built for connecting small businesses to the community around them.

## Vision Statement:

Our vision is to create a platform that bridges businesses and their communities by fostering meaningful connections through shared values. We aim to empower businesses by highlighting what makes them unique and encourage partnerships that align with their missions—whether it’s supporting a cause or uplifting underrepresented communities.

## How?

- Clubs and organizations can post details about their upcoming events and specify the sponsorships, products, or food they’re seeking.
- Small businesses can browse these listings to find events that align with their offerings, allowing them to connect directly with organizers to supply their products or services.

## Future Vision

This project was developed within the limited timeframe of a single day for a hackathon. While there were many features we hoped to include, time constraints made it challenging to implement everything. With this in mind, we designed the project to prioritize scalability, ensuring it can support significant growth and enhancements in the future.

In its finalized form, the company would include the following features:

- A revenue model:
  - Subscription options
  - Advertisements (optional or targeted)
- An event interface designed to enhance the experience for users creating events
- A robust search function to help users find events quickly and efficiently
